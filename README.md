# My-own-Functions
A wip list of functions that I have created.

## Function 1:

### strEasylen

*strEasylen quickly converts a number that you have inputed to string, before counting the length. To do this you first,*

* Bring the code into your program,
* make your variable take an input,
* write, "strEasylen(****Your Function***)" and you're done!*

```
# remember, your input has to be a number.

some_guy's_variable = input()

def strEasylen(some_guy's_variable):
    (str(some_guy's_variable))
    print(len(some_guy's_variable))
    return
```

* Then you type "strEasylen(some_guy's_variable)" and you're done! Whatever number you input will be converted to string and it's length counted. 

## Function 2:

### convlen
