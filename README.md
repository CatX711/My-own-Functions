# My-own-Functions
A wip list of functions that I have created.

## Function 1:

### strEasylen

*strEasylen quickly converts a number that you have inputed to string, before counting the length. To do this you first,*

* Bring the code into your program,
* make your variable take an input,
* write, "strEasylen(****Your Variable****)" and you're done!*

```
# remember, your input has to be a number.

some_guy's_variable = input()

def strEasylen(some_guy's_variable):
    (str(some_guy's_variable))
    print(len(some_guy's_variable))
    return
```

* Then you type "strEasylen(some_guy's_variable)" and you're done! Whatever number you input will be converted to string and it's length counted. 

## Function 2:

### convlen

*convlen means "conveniant length" and, as the name implies, conveniantly quickly measures the length of one of your inputs, without you having to re-write the same old boring code over and over again to do that. To get this function into your program, you first,*

*Bring the code into your program, make one of your variables take an input, write, "convlen(****Your Variable***)", and voila, you're done!*

```
rubbish_bill = input()

def convlen(rubbish_bill):
    print(len(rubbish_bill))
    return
```

## Function 3:

### intEasylen

*intEasylen takes your input, converts it into a string, and then prints the length of it. It is like the opposite of strEasylen, as that function converts your input into string, as this one converts it into an integer*

 ****I think you know how to insert this into your code at this point!****


```
    def intEasylen(number):
        int((number))
        print(len(number))
        return
```
